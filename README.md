## PROJECT-2
    Dropbox Project:

    Base Requirements:

    Local computer can upload/download files from local to remote repository on server computer


11/5:   -Cloned Project 1 because similar functions can be reused for project 2
        -Started making function to move files from remote to local computer. 
11/6:   -Started HTML implementation. Currently you can view the target depository of the remote                computer, but not much else. Only option 1 works, 2 and 3 do not and are just clones. 
        -remote computer must have a repository /home/user/servercatchbox as the directory to hold all of the files. 
        -HIGHLY recommend using keygen ssh to have host computer remember remote computer. 
11/7:   -main page
            View FIles in Server
            Upload Files
            Download Files
11/10:  -HTML is integrated with code. Had to rewrite the base source code. 
        -Upload/Download functions should be easily creatable with current version.
            -expect to be finished tomorrow.
            -need to add in a fourth user prompt to un-hardcode the local servercatchbox.
